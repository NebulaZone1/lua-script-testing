# Lua script testing
 A repo about my lua scripting skills. If you want to try these scripts out. Follow these steps.

# INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
 First, you want to download VS Code (Windows, Linux, macOS):
https://code.visualstudio.com/download

 Next, click on this website to install the tools in order for lua to install on your computer:
https://sourceforge.net/projects/luabinaries/files/latest

 Then, create a folder in Program Files (Local C Drive) and name it "LUA"

 Afterwards, open up the lua download file, drag and drop the files and rename the file "lua53.exe" to "lua.exe", hove over your mouse to where it shows the folder path, click and select all of it and click on copy (or CTRL + C)

 Then, go to System Properties by going to your PC settings, and click on "About PC", click on System Settings

 Once the System Properties page opened up, click the "Advanced" tab, and click on where it says "Environment Variables"

 Click the variable "Path" and click edit, it should open a different page called "Edit environment variable"

 Next, click on the "New" button to write a new variable

 Then, paste what you copied from the LUA folder (the folder path) and press the ENTER key, once you've done that, click OK.

 Open up command prompt, and type "lua -v" to make sure that lua is already installed in your computer

# BEGIN CODING
 Now we can begin scripting, first, create a folder where you can save your lua files, you can name the folder anything you want (ex. LUA Stuff)

 Open up VS Code (if you haven't install it yet, I recommend checking the first step of the instructions), and click on "Open Folder" (CTRL + K or CTRL O) which should bring up a popup to select a folder

 Then, select the folder that you created (depends on where you saved that folder), and VS Code will now open that folder

 To begin scripting, right click on the empty space and select "New File", it should bring up a little textbox to type the file name. Feel free to name whatever file you want but you must end it with ".lua"

 Now it should make a new page with an empty space, ready for you to start coding (You can type your own code or use the examples that I have store in this Github page) (ex. print("This is a test"))

 # TESTING OUT YOUR CODE
 After you're done with your code, click file, then click save to apply your code or changes (CTRL + S)

 Click on the tab named "Terminal" and click on "New Terminal", you should see a box opened and ready to type a command

 To test your code, type in "lua (name of your file).lua"
